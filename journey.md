# üêç A Snake Journey üêç

Basically, I'm a 42 Lausanne student who landed an internship as a Data Engineer. The funny thing is, as a C dev, I code in Python like a caveman. So I challenged myself to create a Snake game (by myself) to memorize Python's syntax and patterns.

## Part 1 | Snake isn't that hard (spoiler: No but Yes)

As developers, we all think we know how Snake should work (or mostly), and so think that it isn't that hard. Spoiler: No. I started coding in 2022, just before the LLM era. Even though I can write and understand code (as we did in the 42 curriculum [writing a clone of bash or Wolfenstein 3D]), I started to become lazy and take shortcuts by asking GPT or Claude to write my ideas for me. The result: I can write code, but I have to make an effort, and it shouldn't be like that because it makes me lose time thinking about trivial things while being able to understand more complicated projects.

Why is this a problem, you'll ask me (if you're not a kernel dev)? I lost the ability to remember/learn simple patterns and became lazy. I can prompt the hell out of LLMs to get what they ask me during my internship and deliver what they expect, but I started losing the fun of programming and thinking "don't worry, I'll get it later", but I never will. So because of that, I started this journey to learn how to write the smallest/most elegant ASCII Snake game, without AI, so I can learn Python, have fun, and stop being lazy (BTW, my nickname is lazzylife, so you know). And boy... struggling to draw a square made me feel like (For Real Bro? You really lost the ability to think that hard?).

For the sake of being honest, and so you can witness my learning journey, I will commit each part of the code so you can follow (if you really want) the process :')

## Part 2 | Claude can do it in 80 lines, But can I do it?
